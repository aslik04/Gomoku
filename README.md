# Gomoku

A terminal Gomoku game in Python with Human vs Human and Human vs Bot modes.

> Built to practice **idiomatic Python** and clean class design.

## Features
- 3 bot levels:
  - **Easy**: random
  - **Medium**: win/block + center/corners
  - **Hard**: minimax + alpha-beta pruning

## Run
```bash
python3 game.py

Input
	•	Enter row and col within board bounds
	•	Symbols: X, O, . (empty)

Note
	•	Level 3 (Hard) is currently not practical to use on larger boards.
	•	Even with alpha-beta pruning, full minimax search space is too large.
	•	Will revisit with depth limits, heuristic evaluation, and candidate move pruning.
